      <h1>About</h1>
      <p style="color: #ffffff;">
        There was once upon a time a shepherd boy whose fame spread far and wide because of the wise answers which he gave to every question.
        <br>
        The king of the country heard of it likewise, but did not believe it, and sent for the boy.
        <br>
        Then he said to him, if you can give me an answer to three questions which I will ask you, I will look on you as my own child, and you shall dwell with me in my royal palace.
        <br>
        The boy said, what are the three questions.
        <br>
        The king said, the first is, how many drops of water are there in the ocean.
        <br>
        The shepherd boy answered, lord king, if you will have all the rivers on earth dammed up so that not a single drop runs from them into the sea until I have counted it, I will tell you how many drops there are in the sea.
        <br>
        The king said, the next question is, how many stars are there in the sky.
        <br>
        The shepherd boy said, give me a great sheet of white paper, and then he made so many fine points on it with a pen that they could scarcely be seen, and it was all but impossible to count them, any one who looked at them would have lost his sight.
        <br>
        Then he said, there are as many stars in the sky as there are points on the paper.
        <br>
        Just count them.
        <br>
        But no one was able to do it.
        <br>
        The king said, the third question is, how many seconds of time are there in eternity.
        <br>
        Then said the shepherd boy, in lower pomerania is the diamond mountain, which is two miles high, two miles wide, and two miles deep.
        <br>
        Every hundred years a little bird comes and sharpens its beak on it, and when the whole mountain is worn away by this, then the first second of eternity will be over.
        <br>
        The king said, you have answered the three questions like a wise man, and shall henceforth dwell with me in my royal palace, and I will regard you as my own child.
