      <p>
        I cross the void beyond the mind
        The empty space that circles time.
        I see where others stumble blind
        To seek a truth they never find.
        Eternal wisdom is my guide.
        I am the Doctor.
        <
        Through cosmic waste the TARDIS flies
        To taste the secret source of life.
        A presence science can't deny
        Exists within, outside, behind
        The latitude of the human minds.
        I am the Doctor.
        My voyage dissects the course of time
        "Who knows?" you say
        But are you right?
        Who searches deep to find the light
        That glows so darkly in the night
        Toward that point I guide my flight.
        As fingers move to end mankind
        Metallic teeth begin their grind.
        With sword of truth I turn to fight
        The satanic powers of the night.
        Is your faith before your mind?
        Know me. Am I, the Doctor?
